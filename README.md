Secure Home Office Network

Scenario: Simulate a home office network with internet access for devices while maintaining security through NAT.
Requirements:

Subnet the network into wired and wireless segments (e.g., for PCs and laptops).

Configure static routing to interconnect subnets.

Use a DHCP server on the router to dynamically assign IPs to devices.

Add a DNS server for resolving both internal and external domain names.

Enable NAT on the home router to translate private IPs to a public IP for internet access.

Include wireless connectivity for mobile workstations.
